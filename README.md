# Random Walk Simulation of a particle in a box
This is a mini project that generates and visualizes data using Python built_in_libraries.

# Project Overview
Random Walk refers to the path an object or molecule takes in any direction influenced by random decisions. This concept has many practical applications in Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Economics.
This project focuses on the practical application of Random Walk in Physics to simulate the behavior of particles in a box. The simulation of this concept helps us visualize the particle from the origin. Each step in the work is influenced by four random choices, either left or right, up or down.

# Requirements
* I used Python as the programming language
  # Library
  * Matplotlib for data visualization

# Install matplotlib
install matplotlib using pip
pip install matplotlib

# Run the simulation
* clone the repository using git clone
* Move to the project directory using cd
* run the Python file 

# Result of the simulation
The output shows a scatter plot that illustrates the path from the origin of the particle in a box to its current location.
